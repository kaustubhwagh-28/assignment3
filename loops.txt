7.	Consider the followng code snippet:
for(int i=0; i<100; i++) { …..
}
Explain in detail how the for loop works. When exactly is the condition checked. When exactly is i incremented. How many times is i set to 0.
In program 2 above, put a semi-colon immediately after the the loop closing parenthesis (& before the brace if present). Will the output change? Why?
Consider the following code snippet:
for(int i=0; i<100; i++)
    for(int j=0; j<100; j++)
	System.out.print(“ Hi”);
How many times will “Hi” be printed?
In the code snippet in the above Q, add another outer loop: for(int a=0; a<100; a++)
Now how many times will “Hi” be printed?
in this the i will be set to 0 only for one time.then i will be incremented then the condition ofi <100 will be checked if it satisfies then it will enter the loop.putting the semicolon 
after for loop parenthesis is equivalent to not writing anything in the loop.

for(int i=0; i<100; i++)
    for(int j=0; j<100; j++)
	System.out.print(“ Hi”);
Hi will be printed 100*100 times.
if we add another loop of for(int a=0; a<100; a++) Hi will be printed 100*100*100 times
