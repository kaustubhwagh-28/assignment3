What is the difference between passing variables by value and by reference?
in pass by reference the actual adress is passed.in pass by value the parameters are passed in another location and send it to the function.
the changes made by the method is not reflected in call by value.whereas in call by reference as we are sending the address the change is reflected in variable


In your programming languages what is passed by value and what is passed by reference:- 
Primitive datatypes.
- Arrays
- Instances of classes defined by the language
- Instance of user defined objects
A2)everything in java is passed by value.we may feel that the instances are passed by reference but it is not like that . we are passing the object reference as a value just like primitive 
datatype.even in arrays the value is the reference to the array.
